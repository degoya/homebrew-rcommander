# rCommander's formula in the tap degoya/homebrew-rcommander, for Linux (RC-100-52). Rendered from
# packaging/homebrew/rcommander.rb.in in degoya/rCommander by scripts/package-managers.sh, and
# replaced by the release workflow with every release: change the template, not this file.
# macOS has the cask (Casks/rcommander.rb), since the macOS package is an app bundle.

  def install
    # The archive stays together in libexec: rCommander installs its bundled plugins from
    # plugins/ beside the executable. bin/ gets a script that execs the real file, so the program
    # runs from the Cellar, where its update check sees that Homebrew updates it.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      rCommander is a desktop program: start it from a graphical session with `rcommander`.
      It needs glibc 2.39 or newer (`ldd --version`) and the system's X11 or Wayland libraries.
      Update it with `brew upgrade rcommander`; it does not replace itself.
